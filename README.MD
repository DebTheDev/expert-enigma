# Trees: Tree DFS

To succeed at this challenge, you'll need to demonstrate that you can do the following:

-   Implement depth-first search traversal of a BST.

## Instructions

Your goal for this checkpoint is to get the tests to pass.

To do so, you will be modifying the existing  `BinarySearchTree`  class to add methods that traverse the BST using in-order, pre-order, and post-order traversals.

### Existing files

File path

Description

`src/BinarySearchTree.js`

Contains the definition of the  `BinarySearchTree`  class. The  `constructor()`  method and methods from the previous checkpoint assignments have already been completed for you.

### Tasks

Complete the following tasks to pass the tests and this assignment.

In the  `src/BinarySeachTree.js`  file, complete the  `dfsInOrder()`,  `dfsPreOrder()`, and  `dfsPostOrder()`  methods to visit the BST using in-order, pre-order, and post-order traversals, respectively.

Once these tasks are complete, all tests should pass.
